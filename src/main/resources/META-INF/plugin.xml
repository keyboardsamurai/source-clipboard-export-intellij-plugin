    <description><![CDATA[<description>
    This plugin automates the inclusion of source code and its file path into your clipboard, streamlining the process
    for analysis and sharing, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs).

    Including the file path with the source code often gives immediate context to the recipient or the processing tool.
    This is particularly useful when sharing code snippets with team members or integrating with AI and LLMs,
    as it clarifies where the code comes from within a project's directory structure.
    It helps in understanding the purpose and scope of the code, especially in large projects with complex directory
    hierarchies and results in better LLM response accuracy and performance.

    <ul>
        <li><b>AI-Ready Sharing:</b> Prepare your code for analysis by AI and LLMs with seamless clipboard integration.</li>
        <li><b>Efficient Collaboration:</b> Enhance your workflow by quickly sharing code and its context with team members or AI tools.</li>
        <li><b>Automated Convenience:</b> Automatically append file paths to clipboard content, saving time and reducing manual errors.</li>
        <li><b>Smart Directory Processing:</b> Automatically processes entire directories, converting code files and their paths into a shareable format, while intelligently skipping binary files to focus on relevant source code.</li>
        <li><b>Limit-Conscious Operation:</b> Designed to manage large data loads efficiently, the plugin caps processing at 50 files to maintain performance and prevent overload.</li>
    </ul>

    Export Source to Clipboard is designed for developers and teams looking to leverage AI in their coding process,
    offering a convenient bridge between your code and the latest AI technologies for analysis and improvement.
    It's an essential tool for anyone aiming to enhance productivity and focus on innovation in the software
    development lifecycle.
